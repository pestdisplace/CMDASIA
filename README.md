# CMDASIA
Real-time PestDisPlace/CMDASIA-infecting geminiviruses in Asia (DNA-A). This is the Nextstrain build for Asia Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD) DNA-A, visible at https://nextstrain.org/community/pestdisplace/CMDASIA Cassava mosaic disease (CMD) in Asia is caused for two different viruses (ICMV and SLCMV). Circular bipartite single-stranded DNA virus belonging to family Geminiviridae (genus Begomovirus). SLCMV was characterized for the first time in Sri Lanka in 1998, it also occurs in India and since 2015 it has emerged in Southeast Asia (SEA). These viruses have two components of DNA. DNA-A, you contain two ORFs in the sense of virion and a complementary sense. DNA-B has an ORF each in virion, as well as in a complementary sense. The viruses are transmitted in a persistent manner by the whitefly Bemisia tabaci, by vegetative propagation using cuttings from infected plants, and occasionally by mechanical means. The symptoms include distortion of leaf lamina, chlorotic mosaics, mottling and an overall reduction in plant size. Data CMD whole-genome sequences were retrieved from Genbank and own (paper in review). Showing 41 of 41 genomes sampled between September 1985 and July 2020, for DNA-A. It has 6 genes.
